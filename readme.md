All tests are skipped by default. Not sure if it's a typescript/jest issue, but I couldn't just run one test file with the watch command. So to use this project, just clone repo, navigate to the exercise folder and locate the test in test.ts. Delete the skip block and try to work your way through te exercise. A sample solution is found in the solution.ts file. I did this for my own learning, so if I did something even slightly different, I've included both my solution as well as Colt Steele's given solution.
